## Requirements
This code was tested with Tensorflow 1.0, CUDA 8.0 and Ubuntu 16.04.  
Training takes about 30 hours with the default parameters on the **kitti** split on a single Titan X machine.  
You can train on multiple GPUs by setting them with the `--num_gpus` flag, make sure your `batch_size` is divisible by `num_gpus`.

## Data
This model requires rectified stereo pairs for training.  
There are two main datasets available: 
### [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/raw_data.php)
We used two different split of the data, **kitti** and **eigen**, amounting for respectively 29000 and 22600 training samples, you can find them in the [filenames](utils/filenames) folder.  
You can download the entire raw dataset by running:
```shell
wget -i utils/kitti_archives_to_download.txt -P ~/my/output/folder/
```
**Warning:** it weights about **175GB**, make sure you have enough space to unzip too!  
To save space you can convert the png images to jpeg.
```shell
find ~/my/output/folder/ -name '*.png' | parallel 'convert {.}.png {.}.jpg && rm {}'
```

### [Cityscapes](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com)
You will need to register in order to download the data, which already has a train/val/test set with 22973 training images.  
We used `leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip` and `leftImg8bit_trainextra.zip` which weights **55GB**.

## Training
The model's dataloader expects a data folder path as well as a list of filenames (relative to the root data folder):  
```shell
python monodepth_main.py --mode train --model_name my_model --data_path ~/data/KITTI/ \
--filenames_file ~/code/monodepth/utils/filenames/kitti_train_files.txt --log_directory ~/tmp/
```
You can continue training by loading the last saved checkpoint using `--checkpoint_path` and pointing to it:  
```shell
python monodepth_main.py --mode train --model_name my_model --data_path ~/data/KITTI/ \
--filenames_file ~/code/monodepth/utils/filenames/kitti_train_files.txt --log_directory ~/tmp/ \
--checkpoint_path ~/tmp/my_model/model-50000
```
You can also fine-tune from a checkpoint using `--retrain`.  
You can monitor the learning process using `tensorboard` and pointing it to your chosen `log_directory`.  
By default the model only saves a reduced summary to save disk space, you can disable this using `--full_summary`.  
Please look at the [main file](monodepth_main.py) for all the available options.

## Testing  
To test change the `--mode` flag to `test`, the network will output the disparities in the model folder or in any other folder you specify wiht `--output_directory`:  
```shell
python monodepth_main.py --mode test --data_path ~/data/KITTI/ \
--filenames_file ~/code/monodepth/utils/filenames/kitti_stereo_2015_files.txt --log_directory ~/tmp/ \
--checkpoint_path ~/tmp/my_model/model-181250
```
If your test filenames contain two files per line the model will ignore the second one, unless you use the `--do_stereo` flag.
The network will output two files `disparities.npy` and `disparities_pp.npy`, respecively for raw and post-processed disparities.

## Evaluation on KITTI
To evaluate run:  
```shell
python utils/evaluate_kitti.py --split kitti --predicted_disp_path ~/tmp/my_model/disparities.npy \
--gt_path ~/data/KITTI/
```
The `--split` flag allows you to choose which dataset you want to test on.  
* `kitti` corresponds to the 200 official training set pairs from [KITTI stereo 2015](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_scene_flow.php?benchmark=stereo).  
* `eigen` corresponds to the 697 test images used by [Eigen NIPS14](http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~deigen/depth/) and uses the raw LIDAR points.

The results on the Eigen split are usually cropped, which you can do by passing the `--garg_crop` flag.

## Models
You can download our pre-trained models to an existing directory by running:  
```shell
sh ./utils/get_model.sh model_name output_directory
```
All our models were trained for 50 epochs, 512x256 resolution and a batch size of 8, please see our paper for more details.  
We converted KITTI and Cityscapes to jpeg before training.  
Here are all the models available:
* `model_kitti`: Our main model trained on the **kitti** split
* `model_eigen`: Our main model trained on the **eigen** split
* `model_cityscapes`: Our main model trained on **cityscapes**
* `model_city2kitti`: `model_cityscapes` fine-tuned on **kitti**
* `model_city2eigen`: `model_cityscapes` fine-tuned on **eigen**

All our models have a Resnet50 variant which you can get by adding `_resnet` to the model name.  
To test or train using these variants, you need to use the flag `--encoder resnet50`.

## Results
You can download our results (unscaled disparities at 512x256) on both KITTI splits (**kitti** and **eigen**) [here](http://visual.cs.ucl.ac.uk/pubs/monoDepth/results/).  
The naming convention is the same as with the models.
