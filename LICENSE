    application in the United Kingdom in connection with the Software. The
    Licensor grants the Licensee for the duration of this Agreement, a free of

    commercially-sponsored research, provision of consulting service, use for or
    on behalf of any commercial entity, and use in research where a commercial

    Software or its associated documentation.

3.  Redistribution and modifications.
    3.1 The Licensee may reproduce and distribute copies of the Software with or

    the following copyright notice is always displayed in an obvious manner:

    3.2 In the case where the Software has been modified, any distribution must
    include prominent notices indicating which files have been changed.

    thereof (“Work based on the Software”), to be licensed as a whole at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this Licence.

    3.4 Each time the Licensee re-distributes the Software or any Work based on
    the Software, the recipient thereof (“Recipient”) automatically receives a
    licence from the Licensor to copy, use, distribute, or modify the Software

    indirect, incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages (including
    but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of
    use, data or profits; or business interruption) however caused and on any
    theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort
    (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use of
    this Software, even if advised of the possibility of such damage.


7.  Indemnity.
    The Licensee or a Recipient (as the case may be) shall indemnify the
    Licensor and/or Authors against all third party claims that may be asserted
    against or suffered by the Licensor and/or Authors and which relate to use
    of the Software by the Licensee or the Recipient.


8.  Intellectual Property.
    8.1 Copyright and all other intellectual property rights subsisting in or in

    agreed by the parties in good faith within a period of six (6) months from
    the date of exercise of the said option (including without limitation any
